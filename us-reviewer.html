        <td>Clarity</td>
        <td>The story is somewhat ambiguous, with vague terms like "wards dashboard view request" and lacks specific details about the expected functionality.</td>

        <td>Completeness</td>
        <td>The acceptance criteria are partially defined but lack preconditions and specific data visualization requirements.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Business Value Alignment</td>
        <td>The story has some relevance to healthcare operations, but the value is not clearly articulated or directly related to patient safety, compliance, or operational efficiency.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Testability</td>
        <td>The story is somewhat testable, but the lack of specific acceptance criteria and preconditions makes it challenging to derive clear test cases.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Technical Feasibility</td>
        <td>The story is somewhat feasible within typical healthcare system constraints, but the lack of specific details about the dashboard and data visualizations raises concerns about implementation complexity.</td>
